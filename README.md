The goal of our project is to provide guidance to car dealers for determining the sale price of a used car while also assisting customers in selecting best-valued used cars to buy. This is achieved by training a model using used car pricing data in the past and analyzing all determining factors in the sale price of used cars. We are also interested in how important each factor is and whether correlations exist between certain factors.
